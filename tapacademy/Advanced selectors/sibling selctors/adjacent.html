element that is directly after another specific element. Sibling
elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means
"immediately following". Letâ€™s now understand adjacent sibling with
an example -->

<!-- In this example, styling is applied to p tag which is immediate sibling
of h1 and h2 tag. The combinatory used for adjacent sibling is +. -->
